# Clean Architecture with DDD with Unit of Work Pattern

[Domain model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html) with a
clean architecture with ports and adapters. It takes into account some tactical
patterns from DDD.

## Unit of work

```typescript
return this.uow.runInTransaction(async (tx) => {
    const updatedWh = await this.saveWh.saveWarehouse(warehouse, tx);
    await this.saveReport.save(report, tx);
    return updatedWh;
});
```

### Module boundaries

If you have a large monolith that contains many
[bounded contexts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html), then the
service can be divided into modules by context.

If you have a micro service architecture and you prefer to allocate contexts to
different services (which is preferable), then the service can be divided into
modules by [aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html).

In this example, there are more than one bounded contexts, you have a monolith
in front of you. And this monolith is internally divided into modules according
to bounded contexts.
